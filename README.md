# Etch a sketch 
One of the last projects of the Foundation course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

In this project I was assigned to make an Etch-a-sketch program in the web browser using the Javascript DOM, I was able to create the 16x16 grid, add eventlisteners so that the squares turn black upon detecting a mouse entering the squares, adding a prompt to the button named "Generate" finally this project was really challenging but it helped my solidize my knowledge of how the DOM works.

#### How to use
Click the "Generate" button to create a large square made up of smaller squares. Hover over the smaller squares to turn them black. Use the "Clear" button to reset the squares.

#### TODO
- ~Add a clear grid function~
- Add an eraser function
- The ability to be able to draw in Etch-a-sketch while holding the mouse button down
