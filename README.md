# Etch a sketch 
One of the last projects of the Foundation course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

In this project I was assigned to make an Etch-a-sketch program in the web browser using the Javascript DOM, I was able to create the 16x16 grid, add eventlisteners so that the squares turn black upon detecting a mouse entering the squares, adding a prompt to the button named "Generate" finally this project was really challenging but it helped my solidize my knowledge of how the DOM works.

#### How to use
Simply click on the button that has the text "Generate" on it, and then the big square will create little squares, and when your mouse hovers over the little squares, they should turn black. Press the "Clear" button if you want to reset the squares.

#### TODO
- ~Add a clear grid function~
- Add an eraser function
- The ability to be able to draw in Etch-a-sketch while holding the mouse button down
